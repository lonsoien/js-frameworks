# JS Frameworks Course Assigment

(No live view)

## Goal

Find an API that returns at least:

   - an array of items
   - a single item retrieved by a parameter (id, name, slug, etc)

Display at least 2 properties from each result.
Each result should link to the detail page, passing a parameter in the URL.

Create a contact form with inputs and validation.

Create a form with username/email and password fields. 
The inputs should have the necessary validation for a login form (not a registration form).
The form should make a login request to either a Wordpress API with the JWT plugin installed or a Strapi API. If the login is successful redirect the user to the admin route.

## Brief

Create either a new React or Next.js app in the repo.

For the login functionality, use either a Wordpress installation with the JWT plugin from Module 3 installed, or a Strapi installation. Do not add either of these to your repo. Your API should remain a separate project. The markers will use their own installations when marking.

You can use either a REST or GraphQL API for the API calls.

## Technologies 

    - React 18.2.0
    - React-Bootstrap 2.5.0
    - Axios
    - Yup

   # Summary 
   
This assignment in Jasvascript Frameworks was a new and challenging task for me. I didnt understand much of the modules given and struggled a lot to solve the task. I have a lot of errors in this repo, and will later on correct it.
I didnt get to solve the goals in this assignments as much as I wanted to, and didnt learn much doing at the time. 
After some tutoring lessons with teacher I feel now more confident to solve the issues with the code.
